Created a program for a movie rental store to initialize contents of a movie inventory by genre, format a customer list, and then process a sequence of inventory, rental, and customer history commands.
There are three genres (comedy, classic, and drama) that are children of the Movie class and are categorized in separate binary search trees.
The text files are input for the program. The test.cpp file tests all the text files.
